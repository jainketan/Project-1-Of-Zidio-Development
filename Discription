Speech Emotion Recognition: Understanding Feelings from Voices
Imagine trying to understand someone's emotions just by listening to their voice. That's the basic idea behind Speech Emotion Recognition (SER).

How does it work?

Recording: A person speaks or sings.
Analysis: The computer breaks down the voice into smaller parts, like pitch, speed, and volume.
Comparison: It compares these parts to known patterns of emotions, like happiness, sadness, anger, or surprise.
Recognition: The computer decides which emotion is most likely based on the comparison.
